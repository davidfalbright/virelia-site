    <summary style="cursor:pointer;font-size:1.2rem;font-weight:600;">For Clients</summary>
    <div style="margin-top:1rem;line-height:1.6;">
      <p><strong>1. Context-Sensitive Ethics</strong><br>
      Unlike simple “yes/no” filters, our framework understands that ethics depend on context. A rule like <em>“Don’t disclose medical advice”</em> can include exceptions (e.g., “permitted for licensed professionals in approved systems”). This gives you guardrails that adapt to real-world conditions, not blunt restrictions.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Localization & Customization</strong><br>
      Every country, industry, or organization has its own standards (HIPAA, GDPR, DoD). With Virelia, you can generate custom belief structures through a guided survey, producing machine-readable policies tailored to your environment. Less guesswork, faster compliance, smoother integration.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Lifecycle Coverage (Training + Production)</strong><br>
      Most solutions work only in <em>training</em> or only in <em>production</em>. We do both. Your AI learns from structured ethics during training, then continues to be monitored and guided in production. That continuity builds reliability and auditability.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Transparent Audit Logs</strong><br>
      Every ethical verdict is logged, showing which rules were applied and why. Think of it as a “CarFax for AI decisions.” Prove to auditors, regulators, or customers that your AI was governed responsibly.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Model-Agnostic Middleware</strong><br>
      Whether you use Hugging Face, proprietary models, or in-house systems, Virelia plugs in as a trust layer. No need to redesign workflows around a single vendor.</p>

    <summary style="cursor:pointer;font-size:1.2rem;font-weight:600;">For Funders & Internal Decision Makers</summary>
    <div style="margin-top:1rem;line-height:1.6;">
      <p><strong>1. True Context-Aware Governance</strong><br>
      Most competitors rely on static guardrails. Virelia uniquely encodes <em>conditional, exception-based ethical logic</em> in reusable, machine-readable form. This enables scalable, context-sensitive AI behavior that others lack.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Localization at Scale</strong><br>
      Few provide a tool-driven path for domain- and culture-specific alignment. Our Belief-Builder tool converts survey responses into structured YAML reservoirs, letting clients encode GDPR, HIPAA, or cultural values <em>without touching training code</em>. This reduces adoption friction and makes localization repeatable.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Unified Lifecycle Integration</strong><br>
      The market is fragmented. Virelia bridges the gap by influencing <em>both training (shaping weights)</em> and <em>production (verdict monitoring)</em>. This closes a major governance gap across the AI lifecycle.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Proof-Oriented Architecture</strong><br>
      Accord logs function as compliance artifacts under EU AI Act and ISO/IEC 42001. This creates potential for insurers and regulators to recognize Virelia logs as a <em>risk-reduction standard</em>, positioning us as a compliance enabler.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Vendor-Neutral Trust Layer</strong><br>
      By positioning as middleware, Virelia avoids vendor lock-in. Competitors push models + policies as bundles; we apply governance across <em>any pipeline</em>. This widens appeal across enterprises, open-source hubs, and governments.</p>
